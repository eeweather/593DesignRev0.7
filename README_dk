top_hdl instantiates four interfaces and four processors. Memory_subsystem updated to handle traffic from all. Probably has problems, didn't dive too deeply into the debug. Changes UVM files to accomidate new processors and interfaces. They are all correctly setup in the needed places but I are not yet sending transactions. See driver, monitor, agent_config, test_base, etc.

top_hdl is the top file now. currently each processor has its own clock which isnt ideal, will move the clock out of processor_if to only have one.

TODO:


move clock and reset out of processor_if, perhaps into memory_if -Emily
Debug logic as we get stimulus 
send traffic on vif_1, vif_2, vif_3 -Emily
build 4 agents -Daniel
Update processor w 4 agents -Daniel
Update coverage for four processors -Julia
run that bitch a bunch
sequences -Victoria 
dummy memory in testbench -Emily
stare into the void and wonder where I went wrong -Daniel
